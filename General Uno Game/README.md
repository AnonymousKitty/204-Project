#Uno Game Code


##This folder contains the python files to run a basic uno game


###So far the program can:
- Pick random cards for players and assign them uno indentities. The program can also join multiple cards together and assign them to a player. 
- Make multiple players, each with different hands, and retreive information of that player such as:
  - Name
  - Number of cards 
  - Specific card
- Retreive information about a specified card such as:
  - Color (if applicable)
  - Number (if applicable)
  - Type
  - String type information of all of the above
- Add and remove cards from a specific player's hand
- Run through the game and keep track of the card on top


###What needs to be done:
- Correct for power up use
- Create an AI for the NPCs
- Make the rules file in a way that another file can ask if a card is valid to be played or not
- Incorporate the rules
- Add some commenting to clarify certain parts
- Run through final draft and debug
