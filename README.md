# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project
## Our Team
* Catarina Borges
* Shrinidhi Thatahngudi Sampath Krishnan
* Zhizhou Huang
* Natasha Sujitharaj

Our group aims to model a 4-player game of Ultimate Uno where our player is down to 3 cards and uses logic to calculate their best card to play. Our model will decide on what the best card to play is (if any) by 
1: Considering if any of our player's cards can be played based on the top card of the pile in the middle 
2: Analyzing the number of cards other players hold.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: This is where the model is being built and solved.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
* `General Uno Game`: This is where we have built out Uno game in python.
