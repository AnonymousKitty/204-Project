# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project
Project file repository for Shrinidhi, Cat, Rad, and Natasha

Our group aims to model a 4-player game of Ultimate Uno where our player is down to 3 cards and uses logic to calculate their best card to play. Our model will decide on what the best card to play is (if any) by analyzing the number of cards other players hold, as well as if any of our player's cards.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: This is where the model is being built and solved.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
